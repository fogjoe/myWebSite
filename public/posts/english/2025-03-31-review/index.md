# 2025-03-31-Review


The last week i joined a review group which is invited by buji sister, and it aims to help people to review in some time that i think this way is good, i maybe not do this by myself, so i'm appreciated for buji's inviting that gives me an opportunity.

This month i felt my body has more and more terrible. I remembered in the start of this month, when i run as usual, my right knee waw so hurt, at first, i didn't think it's important and i run over 5km. In the second day, i thought i'm crippled with one leg walked faster than another and then i looked up some articles i guessed it maybe Llitotibial band friction syndrome, in chinese called '髂胫束综合征'. In this condition, i think i can't run in future because of my bad knee. So what i learned from this thing is that if you met some bad body things, you must stop and check out what's wrong with your body to prevent it to be more bad.

And if i can't exercise, i feel very nervous. So i cycled more and more times, especially, i cycled around the Fuluo Villa more than before where i found many pros who cycles very fast and it give me power to exceed myself. Besides, i started to learn swimming which is very funny, it also helps me to build myself, so even if i can't run, i can find other activities to exercise.

Another thing i want to record the English learning. I found it's very hard for me to hold on day by day. In the first days, i can listen to english videos, but i can't listen them all in my spire time which i want to watch non-english videos, and i don't have much and much motive power to listen, even if i listen in my spire time, i will think other things and i can't pay close attention to the listening contents. So i have two ways to fix it: first i watch vidoes with subtitles not listen videos; second in the evening i listen to the soap opera of Friends one by one word. Ok, it may have some improvings, but in weekends, i don't want to listen and watch, so in next month, i need to solve this problem.
