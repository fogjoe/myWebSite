Several days ago, i listened over the sixth episode. And in this episode, it told three stories: Chandler met a girl who is very flirtatious and spent a happy time with her; Joey had an actor chance to play the butt of AI Pacino; Rachel cleaned the house and moved the position of chair which made Monci so annoyed.

Chandle met a hot girl in the court where Joey had a show, and then they had a date. After they dated, Chan found the girl had a husband, a boyfriend plus Chan. In the first serverl times, he found this relationship was very terrfic. He could have sex, love, fun but have no duty. When dived into more deep, he wanted the girl to belong him only, however when the girl had another man besides his husband and boyfriend, Chandler realized the girl isn't his lover, so they broke.

The begining of this episode was the play of Joey, when he played over, his friends all said it was terrible implictly. Then his agent told Joey he had another audition opportunity. When he was naked to play this role, he might add too many his ideas which made the directors so angry that fired Joey. After he went home and said this, Phoebe comforted Joey: Maybe one day, there will be a guy says: I got the action, i can play Joey Tribbiani's butt. That's so sweet.

Cut to the gang walking back into the apartment, a spotless room suddenly came into view. Who did, Rachel did. But she moved the chair position, ohhh, Monica can't stant up this, so she reset the position, then guys said some things she can't stand, and Chan said: It's a cold drink. It's a hot day. Beads of condensation and inching their way closer to the wood that was the final straw that broke Monica's composure.
