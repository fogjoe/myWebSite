The day before yesterday, i listened over the fifth episode of the first season of Friends. And this episode told three little stories: Joey pursued his ex-girlfriend again; Chandler and Phoebe broke up together; Ross and Rachel went to laundry.

The first story began/started with Joey met/run into his ex-girlfriend which became more beautiful and sexy than before in the Center Park. So he wanted to win her heart again. But in the same time, she had a new boyfriend, so Joey thought a crooked idea: he and Monica to split them and find the piece for themselves. Before they four guys to date, Joey told a lie that his ex two guys are siblings, so when they did some wried things, Monica felt that's so disgusting because she and Ross never do these. Then Joey and Monica used their clever but impractical tricks to win their hearts and sucessfully got together.

And Phoebe and Chandler broken scene was also dramatic. Phoebe broke up with her boyfriend with several seconds, but when it's Chandler's turn, it had a little hard. At first Janice went to the shop and met some unhappy things, but she also bought a pair of socks for Chandler which made much harder for his broke, hence he had to drink too many couples of coffee. Unfortunately, he pauched the Janice accidentally but after Janice went out of the toilet, Phoebe said something to Janice, she frankly accepted Chandler's broke. And when i saw this, my emotion is as the same as Chandler: How do you do that? Phoebe said: it's like a gift.

The third part is about Ray and Ross in the laundry. I think this is the first grown-up for Rachel living in the real world. She had some conflicts with a dominant woman whom thought Rachel was a pushover. But after Ross helped her to get her right from the bad woman, Rachel could take a firm action to stand up for her right. And i'm so happy after she won the guy. Maybe she has some good friends when she has some trouble they can give her their hands and congratulate for her progress.
